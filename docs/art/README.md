# Art direction (every game in the arcade)

Started 2026-10-09 by the Art direction thread, at Evan's request: "we need a thread that develops our graphical
elements and pushes the envelope for our designs and games." **This is the one art guide for the whole arcade.** Each
game has a look sheet that follows it (below); a game never keeps a separate set of rules. Read this before drawing
anything, and before handing a drawing task to another assistant.

**Why our own art matters** (Evan, 2026-10-09): we keep raising the graphics over time, and one day we make a
first-person game in our own style. So every picture we draw is also a plan for a 3D object: the same shapes, sizes
and colours a 3D version would rebuild. Free packs are a bridge; [docs/learning/assets.md](../learning/assets.md)
covers sources, licences and sound.

## The arcade family (what every game shares)
1. **Crisp pixels at one scale.** 16-pixel tiles; the Godot games show 384 by 216 pixels, scaled up by whole numbers
   with nearest filtering. No smoothing, no blur, no anti-aliased edges inside a sprite. Mood (light, fog, weather,
   the faded colour) is added on top by the game, never painted into the sprite.
2. **Real proportions, no chibi.** A person is 16 pixels wide and about 24 tall (1 by 1.5 tiles), with legs (Evan
   rejected big-headed figures on 2026-10-08). Everything is sized against a person: a door 12 by 20, a window 6 to 8
   square, a cottage 3 to 4 tiles wide, a hall 5 to 6, a tree 2 to 3 tiles tall, a cart 2 tiles long.
3. **The footprint is the picture.** What you bump into is exactly the base drawn on the ground (a stone footing, a
   trunk, a fence line), and each object's footprint and height in tiles is written down in data beside the picture.
   That is what lets a 3D or first-person version rebuild the same place (VISION.md V10, Wildbond's WB-M7).
4. **Built from simple shapes.** Boxes, prisms (roofs), cylinders (towers, wells, trunks), cones (pines). A shape you
   could extrude reads clearly at 16 pixels and carries over to 3D.
5. **One outline, one light.** A one-pixel outline in the game's *ink* (a warm near-black, never pure black) around
   objects and people; light from the upper left, so each material has a light, a middle and a dark value and the
   shadow side is the lower right.
6. **Each game has its own palette** of at most about 32 colours, saved as a `.gpl` file (opens in Aseprite,
   LibreSprite, Pixelorama, GIMP, Krita), with three values per material. Games share only the ink and the lamplight
   yellow, so lit windows feel like the same arcade.
7. **Every building is known by its silhouette.** Chimney and glow for a smithy, a tower for a watch, a porch and a
   hanging sign for a tavern, a banner for the guild. If two buildings could swap places unnoticed, one is wrong.
8. **People and creatures are ours,** drawn from parts in code (`figures.gd`), and feelings show as bubbles over heads.
9. **Gentle motion.** Walks of four frames; the world moves a little (smoke, flags, water glints, leaves), never busily.
10. **Readable first.** Text and anything you can use must stand out from the ground (the faded world included); look
    at a real screenshot as a first-time player before calling a piece finished.

## How a piece of art is made and accepted
- **Spec first.** Every drawing task names: what it is, its size in pixels and its footprint in tiles, the palette
  file, the files to produce, and a reference (a look sheet or a mock-up). The template is below.
- **Art as files or as code.** A PNG drawn in an editor, or a small script that draws it (Python with Pillow, in
  `tools/art/`), which any assistant can rerun and adjust. Either way: indexed colours from the palette only, no
  anti-aliasing, transparent background, PNG.
- **Accepted by a side-by-side check.** The pull request shows the piece next to a person and next to its neighbours,
  in a real screenshot of the game when it's wired in. Reviewed in this thread (Art direction) before merge.
- **Credit** anything not ours in CREDITS.md; AI-generated art is allowed and credited the same way.

**Drawing task template** (copy into QUEUE.md or ROADMAP.md):
```
ART-<game>-<n>: <what> (<size in px>, footprint <w x h tiles>, height <tiles>)
Look: docs/art/<game>.md, palette docs/art/<game>/palette.gpl, reference <image>.
Make: <file names> in <folder>; transparent PNG, palette colours only, 1 px ink outline, light from upper left.
States/frames: <lit and unlit, open and shut, seasons...>.
Footprint data: <where the tiles-and-height entry goes>.
Done when: a contact sheet beside a 16x24 person and the neighbouring pieces; reviewed by the Art direction thread.
```

## Look sheets (one per game)
| Game | Sheet | In a line |
|---|---|---|
| Wildbond (Godot) | the Wildbond builder's art direction page, joining this folder as `wildbond.md` | A green river valley losing and regaining its colour: deep valley greens, whitewashed cottages, slate-blue roofs, a red barn |
| Starfall village (Godot) | [starfall.md](starfall.md) | A log-walled frontier town in pine forest: cooler and darker, timber and stone, lamplight at night |
| Realmbound (browser) | not yet | Classic high-fantasy roads and towns; its own sheet comes when it moves into the game window |
| Diamond Career (browser) | not yet | Ballparks under lights; its own sheet with the sports framework |
| Otherworld (browser) | not yet | Each life a different world; a sheet per world |

When a game gets new art, its sheet comes first, then the drawing tasks, then the pieces.
