## The turning year (WS1, docs/proposals/seasons-and-holidays.md). Shared rules for the Godot games: the world keeps
## its own calendar (time moves only while you play), or follows the real one, or holds one season. A season is thirty
## days; a day is five minutes of play, so a season is two and a half hours and a year passes over a full journey.
## Starfall copies this file as it is.
