extends Control
## How to play (Evan, 2026-10-09: "when launching it's not always clear what the controls are"). A page in the same
## book style as the title, with the controls for a keyboard, a phone or tablet, and a gamepad side by side; the one in
## use is marked. It opens before a new journey begins, from the title page, and from the field book's Settings page.
## Any key, tap, click or button closes it.
