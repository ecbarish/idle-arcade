## Wildbond in Godot: the trial slice (2026-10-07; see README.md and docs/wildbond-plan.md).
## Faded Larkhaven, walkable on the real map. Maren walks up and speaks in bubbles over her head; you sign her ranch
## register (the character creator, register.gd) and the ink paints you into the faded world in colour; you follow
## her into her barn, meet three young creatures in their stalls (their pages: card.gd) and choose your partner by
## walking up to one. Colour bursts out of the barn around it, and it follows you from then on.
## People and creatures are built from parts (figures.gd); the ground, trees and buildings are Ninja Adventure tiles
## (CC0); creatures, moves and story data come from the browser game (data/wildbond.json, tools/godot-export.ps1).
## Everything draws on a 384x216 pixel canvas scaled by whole numbers, so it stays crisp on any screen.
