/* Shared roster and jobs for Idle Arcade games (S3, 2026-10-08). Members you aren't playing take jobs; each job
   pays whole units on a timer, like IdleOn's AFK characters but with no daily chores: a job keeps running until you
   change it, and everything comes back in one report.

   Earnings come only from timestamps, so the same stretch of time pays the same whether you were playing, away, or
   on another character, and loading an old save can't pay twice (the job's clock is saved with the reward).
   Time away is capped like rested XP: a job stops earning after `capHours` without being collected.

   const R = Roster.create({
     get: () => state,             the game's saved object; Roster keeps { jobs: { [who]: { job, since } } } in it
     jobs: { id: { name, every(who) seconds per unit, give(who, units) } },
     slots: () => n,               how many members may work at once
     canWork(who),                 optional: false for the member being played, for example
     capHours: 8                   optional
   });
   R.assign(who, job, now?), R.stop(who, now?)   start or stop a job (stopping pays what's earned first)
   R.collect(now?)                               pay every job; returns [{ who, job, units }] for the report
   R.jobOf(who), R.busy(), R.free()              what someone is doing, how many slots are used / left
   R.nextIn(who, now?)                           seconds until their next unit
   R.forget(who)                                 drop a member who no longer exists (nothing is paid)
   Members are keyed by String(who): pass numbers or strings, jobs and reports always use the string form.   */
