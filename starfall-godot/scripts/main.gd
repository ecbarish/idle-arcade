## Starfall: the guild's frontier town (first slice of docs/plans/starfall-village.md). You are the guildmaster.
## Walk the town (arrows or WASD, or click and tap to walk; Enter, Space or E to talk and use things). Pin bounties to
## the guild board; your adventurers choose for themselves, head out through the east gate, and come home with loot
## and bruises. Serve them a hot meal at the inn's counter yourself, until Bryn offers to take the counter over.
## Hurt adventurers rest at the inn until they're well. Nobody dies here; a bad job means a long rest.
